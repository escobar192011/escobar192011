Print("HELLO WORLD! This is real exciting stuff")

Okay, so now this will go to my remote repository. I can share this to the world, provided that I make my repository public. So it appears that I created a repo on Git Hub's server (cloud? Find out what that word means). 

My working directory is my local repo (this file) and I can make these changes and work and blah blah blah.
"Your current working directory is the directory where your commands are being executed. It is typically printed as the full path to the directory (meaning that you can see the parent directory). To print the name of the current working directory, use the command pwd " – some Google search


"If you consider a file in your Working Directory, it can be in three possible states.

It can be staged. 
		Which means the files with the updated changes are marked to be committed to the local repository but not yet committed.

It can be modified. 
		Which means the files with the updated changes are not yet stored in the local repository.

It can be committed. 
		Which means that the changes you made to your file are safely stored in the local repository. " – https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/learn-the-basics-of-git-in-under-10-minutes-da548267cc91/
		
But what about unstaged?

I can see that when I modify this file and write git status, it reads that this file has been modified but is not yet staged to be committed. This is the MODIFIED state.
